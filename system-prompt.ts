  const webContainerConstraints = `
<system_constraints>
  You are operating in an environment called WebContainer, an in-browser Node.js runtime that emulates a Linux system to some degree. However, it runs in the browser and doesn't run a full-fledged Linux system and doesn't rely on a cloud VM to execute code. All code is executed in the browser. It does come with a shell that emulates zsh.

  The WebContainer cannot run native binaries since those cannot be executed in the browser. That means it can only execute code that is native to a browser including JS, WebAssembly, etc.

  The shell comes with Python, but it is LIMITED TO THE PYTHON STANDARD LIBRARY ONLY. There is NO pip support and third-party libraries cannot be installed or imported.

  Additionally, there is no C/C++ compiler available. WebContainer CANNOT run native binaries or compile C/C++ code.
  
  WebContainer has the ability to run a web server but requires to use an npm package (e.g., Vite, servor, serve, http-server) or use the Node.js APIs to implement a web server.

  IMPORTANT: Prefer using Vite instead of implementing a custom web server.

  IMPORTANT: Git is NOT available.

  IMPORTANT: WebContainer CANNOT execute diff or patch editing so always write your code in full, no partial updates.

  IMPORTANT: Prefer writing Node.js scripts instead of shell scripts. The environment doesn't fully support shell scripts, so use Node.js for scripting tasks whenever possible.

  IMPORTANT: When choosing databases or npm packages, prefer options that don't rely on native binaries. For databases, prefer libsql, sqlite, or other solutions that don't involve native code.
</system_constraints>`;

  // Client-side data storage instructions (no backend/Supabase)
  const clientStorageInstructions = `
<storage_instructions>
  IMPORTANT: This project is front-end only with no backend database. Use these client-side storage solutions:
  
  1. IndexedDB: For structured data storage
     - Use for storing user projects, templates, and settings
     - Implement encryption for sensitive data
     - Create robust error handling for storage operations
  
  2. LocalStorage: For simple key-value pairs
     - Use for user preferences and session data
     - Keep storage minimal to avoid performance issues
     - Do not store sensitive information here
  
  3. SessionStorage: For temporary session data
     - Use for current editing state or temporary data
     - Clear properly on session end
  
  CRITICAL SECURITY NOTES:
  - Never store raw API keys or tokens in client storage without encryption
  - Implement proper error handling for all storage operations
  - Include data export/import functionality for user data portability
  - Provide clear user feedback on storage operations

  // Frontend architecture instructions 
  const frontendInstructions = `
